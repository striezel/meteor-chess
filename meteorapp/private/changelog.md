# Changelog of Meteor Chess

## Meteor Chess, version 0.7.1 (2016-10-15)

This release brings some minor improvements:

- Status of connection with the server is shown. This is
  important, because the application will not work properly,
  if the client is disconnected from the server.
- fix an error in parsing Forsyth-Edwards notation

## Meteor Chess, version 0.7 (2016-10-05)

Consider this to be the first "release".
It is not fully feature-complete yet, but it provides everything that two
players need to start and play a match. Therefore, this is the first playable
release.
